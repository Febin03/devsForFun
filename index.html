    <h1>devsForFun(❤️): day 4</h1>
    <p>welcome to day 4! <br> in today’s session, we’ll be going through a little bit of html & css after which you’ll be challenged to create a few things on <a href="https://codepen.io" target="_blank"><code>codepen.io</code></a>
      <br>
      you don’t have to watch day 3 session. this notes will get you up better than the video does. time is precious. i respect yours, therefore this advice.
      <br>
      you don’t have to submit the update for this in a single day, please take your time. the exercise will help you remember and get used to things that matter in HTML (you’ll still have a lot to learn tho!).
      <br>
      and, this note is purposefully made long and time-consuming to make sure you explore and learn about various things, on your own (learning on your own is more important than any other skill, to become a programmer or a developer)
      <br>
      if you want to remember these things, i strongly suggest you come back to this note a second time, around 3 days after you finish it for the first time.
      <br>
      before you continue, please sign up on codepen and then proceed with the practice. otherwise, you won’t be able to save your work.
      <br> <br>
      quote of the day:
      <br>
      <i>“tell me and i forget, teach me and i remember, invlove me and i learn” - benjamin franklin </i>
      <br> <br>
      let’s talk some tech now.
    </p>

    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>
      here’s what you’ll be learning:
      <br>
    <ul>
      <li>a little about HTML</li>
      <li>heading tags</li>
      <li>paragraph tag and <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag</li>
      <li>links & images</li>
      <li>lists</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>A little about HTML</h3>
    <p>
      <b>HTML:</b> Hyper Text Markup Language
      <br>
      <b>Hyper Text:</b> text that links to other documents
      <br>
      <b>Markup Language:</b> a language to mark things!
      <br>
    </p>
    <h3>Heading Tags</h3>
    <p>We have 6 types/sizes of headings in HTML. They are:</p>
    <img src="https://devsforfun.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbe05161a-71c5-47a4-8aad-b71764c4776f%2F60280c64-1186-4fdb-8a4a-ccac97405cd8%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=27d78108-c2de-472e-ab24-120965b5fd7d&spaceId=be05161a-71c5-47a4-8aad-b71764c4776f&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2" alt="" class="image">

    <p>As you may have already noticed, each of them is of different size, indicating different levels of heading, just like in a book (like the Book’s name, chapter’s name, topic name, and so on).
      <br>
      Here, <code>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</code> is called a tag. <code>&lt;h1></code> is called the <b>opening tag</b> and <code>&lt;/h1></code> is called the <b>closing tag</b>.
      <br>
      And, all of <code>&lt;h1>Hello World!&lt;/h1></code> is called an <b>element.</b> Why do you have to learn what it’s called?
      <br>
      They help you communicate your ideas/doubts with others, and for googling. knowing the terms will help you clearly describe the problem you have and thus, easily find a solution for it.
    </p>

    <h3>Paragraph tag & other text formatting text</h3>

    <p>A paragraph tag is usually used to create a paragraph.
      <br>
      It looks like this: <code>&lt;p>&lt;/p></code>
      <br>
      Here’s how it would look like if you used it:
    </p>
    <img src="https://devsforfun.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbe05161a-71c5-47a4-8aad-b71764c4776f%2F47e24238-403a-4a5f-a0ac-04bfe28ea317%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=0e7eb617-d063-40f4-9e54-8d1814570008&spaceId=be05161a-71c5-47a4-8aad-b71764c4776f&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2" alt="" class="image">
    <p>Now, what if you wanted each of the topic names on a different line? <code>&lt;br></code> tag to the rescue!
      <br>
      <code>&lt;br></code> is a special tag that breaks text to a new line. (it doesn’t have a closing tag!)
    </p>

    <h3>Links & Images</h3>
    <p>We can use text to add links to other websites, just like you see in our emails, using the anchor tag.
      <br>
      Here’s an example:
    </p>
    <img src="https://devsforfun.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbe05161a-71c5-47a4-8aad-b71764c4776f%2F9b416426-1935-4cb6-800c-e461b8b6a347%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=e9382acb-add5-4246-b4b8-1ad7bede0bd0&spaceId=be05161a-71c5-47a4-8aad-b71764c4776f&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2" alt="" class="image">

    <p>In the code above, you see some extra text inside the opening <code>&lt;a></code> tag: <a href="https://devsforfun.netlify.app" target="_blank"><code>https://devsforfun.netlify.app</code></a>
      <br>
      Here, <code>href</code> is called the attribute of the <code>&lt;a></code> tag, and the website URL is called it’s value.
      <br>
      So, if you click on the blue text, you’ll be taken to that page.
      <br>
      Similarly, we have the <code>&lt;img></code> tag that doesn’t have a closing tag. it’s used to put images in a website. like so:
    </p>

    <img src="https://devsforfun.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbe05161a-71c5-47a4-8aad-b71764c4776f%2F69dbcc1e-454a-49a3-a345-1575691a30c4%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=c0aed4df-0305-4039-8175-9557fa5d2f7d&spaceId=be05161a-71c5-47a4-8aad-b71764c4776f&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2" alt="" class="image">

    <p>Ss you can see, just like how the <code>&lt;a></code> tag had an attribute called <code>href</code> that we used to create a hyperlink (or a link to another website), the <code>&lt;img></code> tag has the <code>src</code> attribute where we give the image’s URL as value to make the image appear on our website.
      <br>
      How do you get image URLs? just google for your favorite image, right-click on it, and click on <code>copy image address</code>
      <br>
      Sometimes, images might be too large for the screen. find out how would you adjust it’s <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>? (hint: there can be more than one attribute to a tag. or you can just google it.)
    </p>

    <h3>Lists</h3>
    <p>
      In the paragraph’s section, we put all the topic names on a different line. wouldn’t it look nicer if they were a bulleted list? this is something i’ll leave for you to explore.
      <br>
      The output should come out something like this:
    </p>
    <img src="https://devsforfun.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbe05161a-71c5-47a4-8aad-b71764c4776f%2Fb17018b1-1619-429a-9630-577e578f42de%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=a1ebb827-b280-4849-91bb-be7e92bd8828&spaceId=be05161a-71c5-47a4-8aad-b71764c4776f&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2" alt="" class="image">
    <p>There’s another type of list too. that’s called a numbered list. find out and use it here as well.</p>
    <img src="https://devsforfun.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbe05161a-71c5-47a4-8aad-b71764c4776f%2F1e3ecae1-c3ef-404a-8c7a-5117811557c6%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=969e85db-6fa7-4045-804d-df3381317649&spaceId=be05161a-71c5-47a4-8aad-b71764c4776f&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2" alt="" class="image">

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p><b>CSS:</b> Cascading Style Sheets
      <br>
      here’s a peek at how CSS code looks like:
    </p>

    <img src="https://devsforfun.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbe05161a-71c5-47a4-8aad-b71764c4776f%2F8a2c7cb6-2624-493a-9a0b-becc849ebdfe%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=000885fa-fb80-4a3b-98ed-1e4c51c6e03a&spaceId=be05161a-71c5-47a4-8aad-b71764c4776f&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2" alt="" class="image">

    <p><b>selector:</b>it is the element that you want to make styling changes to.
      <br>
      <b>property:</b> it tells about what you want to change in an element
      <br>
      <b>value:</b> well, you guessed it. it defines the change made to the element.
    </p>

    <h3>Let’s format some text</h3>

    <p>Usually, there are several things you can do text. you can change it’s color, size, font, and more.
      <br>
      Let’s do some of this with CSS. but before that, consider the following HTML without CSS:
    </p>
    <img src="https://devsforfun.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbe05161a-71c5-47a4-8aad-b71764c4776f%2Fc4f19578-2546-44d2-bc62-a624d2fa2700%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=15d5b115-f2d4-4008-9b98-2bcf35c196ba&spaceId=be05161a-71c5-47a4-8aad-b71764c4776f&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2" alt="" class="image">

    <p>Here’s the output after applying some CSS:</p>

    <img src="https://devsforfun.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbe05161a-71c5-47a4-8aad-b71764c4776f%2F83bf47a2-70ac-4a38-b88d-a30854ccb647%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=9f960423-ebe9-4917-b611-553753bbd114&spaceId=be05161a-71c5-47a4-8aad-b71764c4776f&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2" alt="" class="image">

    <p>Sometimes, images might be too big for the screen. in that case, you can apply the width & height for the image using css!
      <br>
      Here’s how you can do it:
    </p>

    <img src="https://devsforfun.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbe05161a-71c5-47a4-8aad-b71764c4776f%2Ff501acc6-3edf-4303-9446-5fac6a146adc%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=633e9e45-0538-49cb-8019-a696fdc19e36&spaceId=be05161a-71c5-47a4-8aad-b71764c4776f&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2" alt="" class="image">

    <p>Note the <code>&lt;img></code> selector here, the property width is set to a value 150px</p>

    <h3>3 places you write CSS in</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><b>External CSS</b>: writing CSS outside the HTML file (usually in a .css file) </li>
      <li><b>Embedded CSS</b>: writing CSS inside the <code>&lt;style>&lt;/style></code> tag, in the HTML file.</li>
      <li><b>Inline CSS</b>: writing CSS in the <code>style</code> attribute, in the opening tag of a particular.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>More CSS selectors</h3>

    <p>The main purpose of having CSS selectors is to be able to select the elements we want, and style them the way we want them to be.
      <br>
      What if you wanted to select a particular paragraph and make its text green, but you have more than one paragraph tag? This is where we use something called an <code>id</code>
      <br>
      Consider the following HTML code:
    </p>

    <code>
      &lt;p&gt;first paragraph&lt;/p&gt; <br>
      &lt;p&gt;green paragraph&lt;/p&gt; <br>
      &lt;p&gt;another paragraph&lt;/p&gt; <br>
    </code>

    <p>Usually, to make a paragraph green, we will use the p selector and set the color to green. But, that will make all the paragraphs green. In order to be able to select only a single paragraph tag, we give that <code>&lt;p></code> tag, an id as an attribute and give a name to it as a value like below:</p>

    <code>
      &lt;p&gt;first paragraph&lt;/p&gt; <br>
      &lt;p id=&quot;turn-green&quot;&gt;green paragraph&lt;/p&gt; <br>
      &lt;p&gt;another paragraph&lt;/p&gt; <br>
    </code>

    <p>You can give it any name. Now, you can use this id to select that particular paragraph and style it:</p>

    <code>#turn-green { <br>
      color: green; <br>
      }</code>

    <img src="https://devsforfun.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbe05161a-71c5-47a4-8aad-b71764c4776f%2F801def5c-7aea-4ea7-9370-ade32fff5bc0%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=083fa154-2437-4e87-913c-2130391a6b9d&spaceId=be05161a-71c5-47a4-8aad-b71764c4776f&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2" alt="" class="image">

    <p>Note that the name of the <code>id</code> is preceded by a <code>#</code> sign like this: <code>#turn-green</code> . That is how you tell CSS that it is an <code>id</code>.
      <br>
      You can only use an <code>id</code> with only one element. You can try to use it with other elements and the styling may still apply to all of them. But, that is not recommended because this will cause strange behavior of the code when writing JavaScript (we’ll talk about this again with JavaScript.)
      <br>
      What if you wanted to color the first and last paragraphs in the above HTML code with the color? You can give a common <code>class</code> to both of them and write your styles with the class.
      <br>
      What is a <code>class</code>? it is just like an <code>id</code> but you can use it with multiple tags. Here’s the HTML code:
    </p>
    <code>
      &lt;p class=&quot;purple-text&quot;&gt;first paragraph&lt;/p&gt; <br>
      &lt;p id=&quot;turn-green&quot;&gt;green paragraph&lt;/p&gt; <br>
      &lt;p class=&quot;purple-text&quot;&gt;another paragraph&lt;/p&gt; <br>
    </code>

    <p>and the CSS:</p>

    <code>
      #turn-green {
      color: green;
      }

      .purple-text {
      color: purple;
      }
    </code>

    <p>Note that the name of the class is preceded by a . symbol in the CSS code.</p>
